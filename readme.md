# Blockchain Use Case Research

Binance utilizes smart contracts with their BNB Smart Chain to facilitate the building of dApps to allow developers to create projects taking advantage of the benefits that the BNB token provides. The BNB Smart Chain utilizes the BEP-20 token standard, which is very similar to the ERC-20 standard. The standard acts like a guide and blueprint for how to utilize the BEP-20 standard.
